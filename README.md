## Running the Game

This game was developed using PyCharm, so it should work as intended using most IDEs. 

at the command line.

## Gameplay

### Playing the Game

After pressing play, your character will appear in the middle of the screen. The default controls are below:

 ```
 W: Move Up
 S: Move Down
 A: Move Left
 D: Move Right
 
 O: Increase Player Size + Speed
 P: Decrease Player Size + Speed
 ```
 
 There are 3 categories of obstacles, and 5 individual obstacles.
 
  - Good
    - Cheese
    - Chilli
  - Bad
    - Pineapple
    - Chocolate 
  - Power-Up
    - x2 Score Booster
    
Obstacles will enter from the right hand side and exit from the left. But be aware, after a certain score, obstacles come in from both directions! Hitting a good obstacle will increase your score by 1, while hitting a bad obstacle will end the game. However, if you hit a power-up (which has a 1/100 chance of appearing in place of a good/bad obstacle), you will get a boost for a small period of time- make the most of it!

So far, there is only 1 power-up: the x2 Score Booster. When you hit it, all the points you get while the boost is active will be multiplied by 2. You can see the duration left on the boost in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen.

### Shop

In the shop, you can buy three things: backgrounds, skins, and shields. Skins are what your player looks like while you are playing the game. Backgrounds are, well, backgrounds, but you can only upgrade them. If you choose to buy the next background, you cannot go back to your previous background. Shields are another power-up, but shields cannot be obtained in normal gameplay. You can buy a shield, and if you hit an obstacle while you have 1 or more shields, the game will not end, and you will instead lose a shield.

## Thank you!

This game was the first medium-sized project that I made in Python, and I would appreciate it if you gave me some advice! Thank you so much if you decided to try my game out!
